Methods are functions that belongs to the class.

There are two ways to define functions that belongs to a class:

    Inside class definition
    Outside class definition

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
  public:
    //Inside Class
    void display(){
      cout<<"Hello World\n";
    }
    
    int speed(int maxSpeed);
};

//Outside Class
int Car::speed(int maxSpeed) {
  return maxSpeed;
}

int main() {
  Car myObj; // Create an object of Car
  cout << myObj.speed(200); // Call the method with an argument
  return 0;
}

In Python, you don't define methods outside of the class definition as you do in C++. 
However, you can achieve similar functionality by defining a function outside of the 
class and then assigning it as an attribute of the class. Here's how you can do it:

def display(self):
    print("Hello World!")

class MyClass:
    pass

# Assigning the function as a method of the class
MyClass.display = display

# Main code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_obj = MyClass()   # Create an object of MyClass
    my_obj.display()   # Call the method
    print(MyClass.__dict__)
